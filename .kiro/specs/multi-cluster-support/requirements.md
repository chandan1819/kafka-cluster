# Multi-Cluster Support Requirements

## Introduction

This feature extends the Local Kafka Manager to support managing multiple Kafka clusters simultaneously. Users will be able to create, configure, and manage multiple isolated Kafka environments from a single interface, enabling better development workflows, testing scenarios, and environment separation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cluster Registry Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to register and manage multiple Kafka clusters so that I can work with different environments (dev, test, staging) from one interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the cluster registry THEN the system SHALL display all registered clusters with their status
2. WHEN I register a new cluster THEN the system SHALL validate the cluster configuration and store it persistently
3. WHEN I update cluster configuration THEN the system SHALL apply changes and update the cluster status
4. WHEN I delete a cluster THEN the system SHALL stop all services and remove all associated data
5. IF a cluster registration fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and rollback any partial changes

### Requirement 2: Multi-Cluster API Operations

**User Story:** As an API user, I want to perform operations on specific clusters so that I can manage resources across different environments programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make API calls THEN the system SHALL accept a cluster identifier parameter to target specific clusters
2. WHEN I list topics THEN the system SHALL return topics from the specified cluster or all clusters if no cluster is specified
3. WHEN I produce messages THEN the system SHALL route messages to the correct cluster based on the cluster identifier
4. WHEN I consume messages THEN the system SHALL consume from the specified cluster's topics
5. IF an invalid cluster identifier is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error with cluster suggestions

### Requirement 3: Cluster Isolation and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want each cluster to be completely isolated so that operations on one cluster don't affect others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple clusters are running THEN each cluster SHALL use unique ports and network configurations
2. WHEN I start a cluster THEN the system SHALL ensure no port conflicts with existing clusters
3. WHEN I stop a cluster THEN the system SHALL only affect that specific cluster's services
4. WHEN clusters are running THEN each cluster SHALL have isolated data directories and configurations
5. IF resource conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prevent cluster startup and suggest alternative configurations

### Requirement 4: Cluster Templates and Presets

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create clusters from predefined templates so that I can quickly set up standard configurations for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new cluster THEN the system SHALL offer predefined templates (development, testing, production, high-throughput)
2. WHEN I select a template THEN the system SHALL pre-populate cluster configuration with appropriate settings
3. WHEN I save a custom configuration THEN the system SHALL allow me to create a new template from it
4. WHEN I modify a template THEN the system SHALL update all clusters using that template (with user confirmation)
5. IF template application fails THEN the system SHALL revert to default configuration and log the error

### Requirement 5: Cross-Cluster Operations

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to perform operations across multiple clusters so that I can migrate data and compare configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initiate data migration THEN the system SHALL copy topics and messages from source to destination cluster
2. WHEN I compare clusters THEN the system SHALL show differences in topics, configurations, and message counts
3. WHEN I replicate topics THEN the system SHALL create identical topic structures across specified clusters
4. WHEN I monitor multiple clusters THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated metrics and health status
5. IF cross-cluster operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Web Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a visual interface to manage multiple clusters so that I can easily switch between and monitor different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a cluster selector with all registered clusters
2. WHEN I switch clusters THEN the system SHALL update all views to show data from the selected cluster
3. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show status cards for all clusters with key metrics
4. WHEN I manage topics THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which cluster I'm working with
5. IF a cluster is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate status indicators and error messages

### Requirement 7: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to manage cluster configurations through code so that I can version control and automate cluster setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define cluster configurations THEN the system SHALL support YAML/JSON configuration files
2. WHEN I import configurations THEN the system SHALL validate and apply cluster settings
3. WHEN I export configurations THEN the system SHALL generate complete cluster definition files
4. WHEN configurations change THEN the system SHALL track changes and provide rollback capabilities
5. IF configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed validation errors with suggestions

### Requirement 8: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to control access to different clusters so that I can implement proper environment separation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access clusters THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access control per cluster
2. WHEN I configure permissions THEN the system SHALL support different access levels (read, write, admin) per cluster
3. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL show only clusters they have access to
4. WHEN audit logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log all cluster operations with user identification
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the security event
