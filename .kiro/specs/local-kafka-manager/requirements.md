# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a self-service, local Kafka cluster management solution that enables developers to provision, control, and monitor a full-featured Kafka stack entirely on their local machine. The solution includes a Python-based REST API, JSON service catalog, Kafka REST Proxy, and web UI components, all orchestrated locally without requiring Kubernetes or cloud dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start and stop a local Kafka cluster via REST API, so that I can programmatically manage my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a POST request to /cluster/start THEN the system SHALL launch a local multi-node Kafka cluster using KRaft mode
2. WHEN I send a POST request to /cluster/stop THEN the system SHALL stop all running Kafka services and containers
3. WHEN I send a GET request to /cluster/status THEN the system SHALL return the current status and health of the cluster
4. WHEN the cluster is started THEN the system SHALL expose Kafka broker on localhost:9092
5. IF the cluster fails to start THEN the system SHALL return an error response with diagnostic information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access a JSON-based service catalog, so that I can discover available services and API endpoints programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a GET request to /catalog THEN the system SHALL return a JSON response containing cluster status, broker information, and available endpoints
2. WHEN the catalog is requested THEN the system SHALL include real-time configuration and status information
3. WHEN services are running THEN the catalog SHALL list all available API endpoints with descriptions
4. WHEN topics exist THEN the catalog SHALL include topic metadata (name, partitions, replication factor)
5. WHEN the cluster is stopped THEN the catalog SHALL reflect the offline status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage Kafka topics via REST API, so that I can automate topic lifecycle operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a GET request to /topics THEN the system SHALL return a list of all existing Kafka topics
2. WHEN I send a POST request to /topics with topic configuration THEN the system SHALL create a new Kafka topic
3. WHEN I send a DELETE request to /topics/<name> THEN the system SHALL delete the specified topic
4. WHEN creating a topic THEN the system SHALL validate partition count and replication factor parameters
5. IF a topic creation fails THEN the system SHALL return an error response with the failure reason

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to produce and consume messages via REST API, so that I can test Kafka functionality without writing Kafka client code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a POST request to /produce with message data THEN the system SHALL send the message to the specified topic via Kafka REST Proxy
2. WHEN I send a GET request to /consume THEN the system SHALL fetch messages from the specified topic and consumer group
3. WHEN producing messages THEN the system SHALL support JSON message format
4. WHEN consuming messages THEN the system SHALL return messages in JSON format with metadata
5. IF message production fails THEN the system SHALL return an error response with details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to a web-based Kafka UI, so that I can visually inspect and manage my Kafka cluster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cluster is started THEN the system SHALL launch a Kafka UI container accessible at localhost:8080
2. WHEN I access the UI THEN the system SHALL display cluster status, topics, and consumer groups
3. WHEN the UI is running THEN the system SHALL allow topic creation and message inspection through the web interface
4. WHEN the cluster is stopped THEN the UI SHALL be stopped as well
5. IF the UI fails to start THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other services

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entire stack to be orchestrated with Docker Compose, so that I can easily manage multiple services as a unit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL use Docker Compose to orchestrate Kafka, REST Proxy, and UI services
2. WHEN services are launched THEN the system SHALL ensure proper service dependencies and startup order
3. WHEN the system stops THEN it SHALL cleanly shut down all Docker containers
4. WHEN services are running THEN the system SHALL expose Kafka REST Proxy on localhost:8082
5. IF Docker is not available THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating Docker is required

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I can understand and integrate with all available endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python REST API starts THEN the system SHALL auto-generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
2. WHEN I access the API docs THEN the system SHALL display all available endpoints with request/response schemas
3. WHEN endpoints are added THEN the documentation SHALL automatically update to reflect new capabilities
4. WHEN I view the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide example requests and responses
5. WHEN the API is running THEN the documentation SHALL be accessible via a web interface

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single installation script, so that I can set up the entire stack with minimal effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the installation script THEN the system SHALL check for and install all required dependencies
2. WHEN installation completes THEN the system SHALL verify that Docker and Docker Compose are available
3. WHEN the script runs THEN it SHALL pull all necessary Docker images
4. WHEN installation is successful THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for starting the services
5. IF prerequisites are missing THEN the script SHALL provide clear instructions for manual installation
