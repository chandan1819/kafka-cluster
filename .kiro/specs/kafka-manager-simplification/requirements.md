# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to simplify the Local Kafka Manager application by removing unnecessary complexity, fixing port configuration issues, and creating a streamlined user experience. The goal is to transform the current over-engineered multi-cluster system into a simple, easy-to-use local Kafka management tool that runs on a standard port (5000 or 5001) and focuses on core functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple local Kafka manager that runs on a standard port (5000 or 5001), so that I can easily manage my local Kafka cluster without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL run on port 5000 by default
2. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN it SHALL provide a simple web interface for Kafka management
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL automatically detect and connect to the local Kafka cluster
4. IF port 5000 is occupied THEN the application SHALL try port 5001 as fallback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to have only essential features for local development, so that it's lightweight and easy to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN it SHALL contain only core Kafka management features
2. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL support basic cluster operations (start/stop/status)
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL support basic topic operations (create/list/delete)
4. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL support basic message operations (produce/consume)
5. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN it SHALL NOT contain multi-cluster support
6. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN it SHALL NOT contain advanced monitoring features
7. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN it SHALL NOT contain authentication/security features
8. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN it SHALL NOT contain complex middleware

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want minimal dependencies and no unnecessary test files, so that the application is lightweight and easy to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing requirements.txt THEN it SHALL contain only essential dependencies
2. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN it SHALL NOT contain extensive test suites
3. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN it SHALL NOT contain performance testing
4. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN it SHALL NOT contain integration testing beyond basic functionality
5. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN it SHALL NOT contain benchmarking tools

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to have a clean project structure, so that I can easily understand and modify the code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN it SHALL have a simple directory layout
2. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN it SHALL have clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN it SHALL have minimal configuration files
4. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN it SHALL NOT contain unused folders or files
5. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN it SHALL NOT contain backup files or deprecated code

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to start quickly and work out of the box, so that I can focus on my development work rather than configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN it SHALL start within 10 seconds
2. WHEN starting the application THEN it SHALL automatically configure itself for local development
3. WHEN starting the application THEN it SHALL provide clear feedback about its status
4. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide simple, actionable error messages
5. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL automatically start the required Kafka services
